Horizons Pre-Commit Audit: Open Issues
=======================================
Generated: 2026-02-05

CRITICAL
--------

1. SDKs missing Engine/Sandbox endpoints -> fix
   Both Python (horizons_py/) and TypeScript (horizons_ts/) SDKs have zero
   coverage of the new /api/v1/engine/* endpoints (run, start, events SSE,
   release, health). Users cannot programmatically kick off sandboxed agents
   from SDK code.
   Affected files:
     - horizons_py/horizons/  (needs engine.py)
     - horizons_ts/src/       (needs engine.ts)

-> this can wait unitl next rleease - let's plan  a follow-on release withh this and other
2. No production VectorStore backend
   The VectorStore trait is defined in horizons_core/src/onboard/traits.rs
   and DevVectorStore exists in dev_backends.rs (in-memory HashMap with
   cosine similarity). No production implementation (Qdrant, Pinecone,
   pgvector, etc.) exists. Voyager memory only works in dev mode.
   Affected files:
     - horizons_core/src/onboard/ (needs e.g. qdrant.rs or pgvector.rs)


IMPORTANT
---------
-> these can wait 
3. Missing connectors (5 of 7 specced)
   Spec lists 7 connectors. Only 2 implemented:
     DONE:    Jira, LinkedIn
     MISSING: Gmail, Slack, Linear, GitHub, HubSpot/CRM
   Affected files:
     - horizons_integrations/src/connectors/ (needs gmail.rs, slack.rs,
       linear.rs, github.rs, hubspot.rs)
-> this sohould be prioritzed, check how archiepolago stuff in fhodes does it
4. MCP server integration incomplete
   horizons_core/src/core_agents/mcp.rs has MCP client traits and
   scope-checking logic but no actual MCP JSON-RPC server or tool
   registration. Defines the interface for MCP auth-based approvals
   but does not connect to a real MCP server.
   Affected files:
     - horizons_core/src/core_agents/mcp.rs
-> yep
5. Outbound webhook delivery missing
   Event Router (events/router.rs) handles routing logic. Inbound webhook
   receiver (events/webhook.rs) works. But there is no outbound webhook
   HTTP sender that POSTs events to registered webhook URLs.
   Affected files:
     - horizons_core/src/events/ (needs outbound_webhook.rs or similar)


MODERATE
--------
-> add
6. TypeScript SDK missing query()/execute() on Projects
   Python SDK has query() and execute() methods for running SQL on project
   DBs. TypeScript SDK is missing these.
   Affected files:
     - horizons_ts/src/onboard.ts
-> dockerfile for now
7. No production deployment configs beyond basic Dockerfile
   Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml work for dev. Missing:
     - Kubernetes manifests
     - Production environment variable templates
     - Multi-service docker-compose (Horizons + Postgres + Redis + HelixDB)
     - Deployment runbooks
-> make explicit
8. Dockerfile builds without --features all
   The Dockerfile runs `cargo build --release -p horizons_rs` without
   --features all, so memory/optimization/evaluation modules are excluded
   from the Docker image. May be intentional but should be explicit.
   Affected files:
     - Dockerfile
